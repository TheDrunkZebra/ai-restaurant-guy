## Executive Summary

This is a **productized service** business — NOT a consulting or agency model.

**The Key Insight:**
- **Setup hours** (15-50 hrs) are ONE-TIME, covered by setup fee
- **Maintenance hours** (3-8 hrs/mo) are RECURRING, generating 80-90% margins

Your systems are already built for your restaurants. For new clients you're:
1. Cloning and customizing (not building from scratch)
2. Connecting to their data sources (POS, bank, vendors)
3. Configuring for their specific menu/costs
4. Monitoring and adjusting (light ongoing work)

**Result:** 80-90% monthly margins after setup is complete.

---

## The Two Types of Hours (Critical Distinction)

| Hour Type | When | How Many | Frequency |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Build/Setup Hours** | Onboarding | 15-50 hrs | ONE TIME |
| **Maintenance Hours** | Ongoing | 3-8 hrs/mo | RECURRING |

**Developer Rate:** $50/hr (quality offshore or US-based part-time)

## CORRECT Unit Economics: The "Build Once, Maintain Light" Model

### Foundation Tier — Corrected

| Developer cost @ $50/hr | $750-$1,250 |
| **Setup Profit** | **$750-$1,250** ✅ |

**Ongoing Phase (Monthly):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Monthly fee collected | $2,000 |
| Maintenance hours | 3-5 hrs/mo |
| Developer cost @ $50/hr | $150-$250 |
| Tools/APIs | ~$50 |
| **Monthly Profit** | **$1,700-$1,800 (85-90% margin)** ✅ |

---

### Growth Tier — Corrected

**Setup Phase (One-Time):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Setup fee collected | $3,500 |
| Developer hours (build/customize) | 30-50 hrs |
| Developer cost @ $50/hr | $1,500-$2,500 |
| **Setup Profit** | **$1,000-$2,000** ✅ |

**Ongoing Phase (Monthly):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Monthly fee collected | $4,000 |
| Maintenance hours | 5-8 hrs/mo |
| Developer cost @ $50/hr | $250-$400 |
| Tools/APIs | ~$100 |
| **Monthly Profit** | **$3,500-$3,650 (87-91% margin)** ✅ |

---

### Scale Tier — Corrected

**Setup Phase (One-Time):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Setup fee collected | $5,000 |
| Developer hours (build/customize) | 40-60 hrs |
| Developer cost @ $50/hr | $2,000-$3,000 |
| **Setup Profit** | **$2,000-$3,000** ✅ |

**Ongoing Phase (Monthly):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Monthly fee collected | $5,500 |

## What Monthly Maintenance Actually Looks Like

| Task | Frequency | Hours |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Review automation monitoring | Weekly | 0.5 hr |
| Invoice processing check | Weekly | 0.5 hr |
| Dashboard/report review | Weekly | 0.5 hr |
| Contract monitoring alerts | As needed | 0.5 hr |
| Bug fixes/adjustments | As needed | 1-2 hrs |
| Client questions/support | As needed | 1-2 hrs |
| **Total** | | **4-6 hrs/mo** |

Most of this can eventually be automated further or handled by a VA, not even a developer.

|--------|--------|-----|
| Setup hours per client | <30 hrs | Efficiency of your templates |
| Maintenance hours per client | <5 hrs/mo | System stability |
| Client acquisition cost | <$1,000 | Marketing efficiency |

| Gross margin | >80% | Business health |

---

## Hiring Structure

### Role 1: Setup Developer
- **Job:** Build/customize systems for new clients
- **Hours:** Scales with new client acquisition
- **Pay:** $50-75/hr or project-based ($1,000-$2,000 per setup)

### Role 2: Maintenance (Can Be Same Person Initially)
- **Job:** Monitor systems, fix issues, handle support
- **Hours:** Scales with total client count
- **Pay:** $30-50/hr or retainer ($2,000-$3,000/mo for up to 10 clients)

### You
- **Job:** Sales, strategy, client relationships, quality control
- **Hours:** 20-30 hrs/week
- **Pay:** Profit distributions

---

## The Actual Plan

### Immediate (This Month):
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Price it right | $2,000 setup + $2,000/mo (Foundation) |
| Close 2-3 clients | You do the setup yourself initially |
| Document your setup process | So you can hand it to a developer |
| Find a developer | Part-time, $50/hr, US-based or quality offshore |

### Month 2-3:
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Hand off setups to developer | You oversee, they build |
| You focus on sales | Target 2 new clients/month |
| Track maintenance hours | Validate the 3-5 hr/client assumption |

### Month 4-6:
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| 8-10 clients | $20,000-28,000 MRR |
| Developer on retainer | $2,500-3,500/mo for setups + maintenance |
| Consider VA | For client communication, scheduling |
| Take profit | You should be clearing $15k+/mo personally |

---

## Why This Works: What You Must Believe

1. **Setup hours stay under 30** — If customization takes 60+ hours, you lose money on setup
2. **Maintenance stays under 6 hrs/mo** — If systems need constant fixing, margins erode
3. **Clients stay 6+ months** — Churn kills this model
4. **You can sell** — The business prints money once clients are signed

Your templates, documentation, and system stability are the keys. The better your base systems, the faster/cheaper each client setup becomes.

---

## Capacity Limits

**Hard cap until developer hire: 5 concurrent clients**

| Stage | Your Hours/Month | Max Clients |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Solo (setups yourself) | 60-80 hrs | 2-3 |
| With 1 developer | 20-30 hrs | 8-10 |
| With dev + VA | 15-20 hrs | 15-20 |

**Waitlist activated at capacity. Do not oversell.**

---

## Client Qualification Criteria (Must Meet 3/5)

1. **Revenue:** $1.5M–$5M annual
2. **Vendor spend:** >$150k/year
3. **Active manager:** Available for onboarding, checks email daily
4. **Growth mindset:** Wants systems, not just cost-cutting
5. **Clean data:** Can provide contracts, POS exports, bank statements

**If they don't meet 3/5, decline or require prepayment.**

---

## SLA Commitments

| Tier | Response Time | Report Delivery | Check-in Frequency |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Foundation | 48 hrs | Weekly | Monthly |
| Growth | 24 hrs | Weekly | Bi-weekly |
| Scale | Same-day | Daily + weekly | Weekly |

---

## Guarantee Language (Use Exactly)

**Foundation:**
> "2x your monthly fee in documented savings within 30 days—or we work free until you hit it."

**Growth:**
> "Find your first $10k in savings + systemize your weekly operations within 60 days—guaranteed."

**Scale:**
> "30% reduction in your operational time + full visibility into your locations within 90 days—or your setup fee refunded."

---

## Objection Rebuttals (Use Verbatim)

**"We already use Toast/7shifts/MarketMan"**
> "Great—so do we. We don't replace those. We sit on top of them and make them talk to each other. Toast tells you what sold. We tell you whether you made money on it."

**"We can't afford $2,000/month right now"**
> "That's why we start with the $500 Savings Audit. We find money in your contracts first—usually $5k-$15k. That funds the monthly fee. If we don't find anything, the $500 is refundable."

**"How do I know this actually works?"**
> "Our restaurants. Three locations. $120k overhead reduced. 46% prime cost. We're not selling software we built in a garage. We're selling systems we run every day."

**"I don't have time to implement another system"**
> "That's the point—you don't implement anything. You upload contracts and grant us access. We do the processing. You get a weekly summary and a priority list."

**"What if it doesn't work for my restaurant?"**
> "Then we work free until it does. 2x your monthly fee in documented savings within 30 days. Not 'we'll try.' Not 'results may vary.' 2x or we work free."

---

## Contract Terms (Non-Negotiable)

1. **6-month minimum term** (all tiers)

3. **Setup fee due 50% upfront, 50% at delivery**
