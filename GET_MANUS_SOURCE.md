# How to Get Full Source Code from Manus Site

## 🎯 Best Method: Manus Editor Export

### Step 1: Access Manus Editor
1. Go to https://manus.im
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your space/project (ID: `lxohzush`)

### Step 2: Export Source Code
Look for one of these options:
- **"Export"** button in the editor toolbar
- **"Download"** in project settings
- **"Export Project"** in the menu
- **"Source Code"** download option

### Step 3: What to Look For
You should get a ZIP file containing:
- `src/` folder with React components
- `package.json`
- `vite.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- All component files (`.jsx`)

## 🔍 Alternative: Extract from Live Site

If Manus doesn't have export, we can extract from the live site:

### Method A: Browser DevTools
1. Open https://lxohzush.manus.space/
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Sources** tab
4. Look for:
   - `webpack://` or `src/` in the file tree
   - React component files
   - Copy the component code

### Method B: Network Tab
1. Open DevTools → **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for source map files (`.map` files)
4. These contain the original source code

### Method C: React DevTools
1. Install [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) browser extension
2. Open the site
3. Use React DevTools to inspect component structure
4. Can see component hierarchy and props

## 🛠️ What I Can Do Right Now

While you get the source, I can:

1. **Update colors to match Manus** (`#0B0F14` background)
2. **Update hero text** to "Hire a 24/7 AI Crew..."
3. **Extract component structure** from the built JS file
4. **Create a migration script** to help merge

## 📋 Quick Actions

### Option 1: I Extract & Rebuild (Faster)
- I'll analyze the live site structure
- Recreate the components based on what I see
- You review and we refine

### Option 2: You Export & We Migrate (More Accurate)
- You get the source from Manus
- Share the files with me
- I'll migrate everything exactly

## 🚀 Let's Start: Quick Color Update

I can update your current site to match Manus colors RIGHT NOW. Should I do that?

This will:
- ✅ Change background to `#0B0F14`
- ✅ Keep everything else working
- ✅ Make it look closer to Manus site

Then we can work on the full migration once you have the source code.

**Which do you prefer?**
1. **Quick fix now** (update colors + hero text)
2. **Wait for source code** (full migration)
3. **Both** (quick fix + full migration later)
