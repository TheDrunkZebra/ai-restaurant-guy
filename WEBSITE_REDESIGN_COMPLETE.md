**Date:** February 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **REDESIGN COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

The website has been completely reworked to be cleaner, more impressive, and easier for restaurant owners to understand. Removed the dark, technical sections and replaced them with clear value propositions and ROI-focused content.

---

## 📋 New Structure

### 1. ✅ Hero Section (`src/HeroSection.jsx`)
- **Clean split-screen layout** with portrait on the right
- **Clear headline**: "Replace Your $6,000 Agency and Your $150/hr CFO with One System."
- **Scannable metrics**: $72k recovered, 80+ hours back/month, 3% prime cost drop
- **Two clear CTAs**: "Shop the Systems" and "Free Revenue Audit"
- **Social proof badges**: Built in Salty Zebra, $100k+ labor saved
- **Portrait image**: `/seamus-portrait.jpg` (needs to be added - see below)

### 2. ✅ Shop the Systems (`src/ShopTheSystems.jsx`)
- **Kept as-is** - This component was already good
- Shows all products clearly in a 2x2 grid
- Clear pricing and descriptions

### 3. ✅ Case Study Section (`src/CaseStudy.jsx`) - NEW
- **Real metrics showcase**: $72k eliminated, 2 days/month on-site, 3% prime cost drop, 5 platforms dominated
- **The Lightbulb Moment story**: Clear narrative about the system's impact
- **Restaurant owner testimonial**: From Seamus O'Brien
- **Easy to scan**: Big numbers, clear benefits

### 4. ✅ Revenue Recovery Audit (`src/RevenueRecoveryAudit.jsx`)
- **Kept as-is** - Already has good form structure
- Clear value proposition for restaurant owners

### 5. ✅ App Structure (`src/App.jsx`)
- **Clean, simple layout**: Hero → Shop Systems → Case Study → Revenue Audit → Footer
- **Removed dark/technical sections**: No more "Lazy Tax Terminal", "Market Intelligence Suite", "AI Workforce", "Manager Agent Dashboard"
- **Restaurant-owner friendly**: Everything is clear and scannable

## 🖼️ Image Setup Required

### Portrait Image
The hero section uses `/seamus-portrait.jpg` which needs to be added to the `public` folder.

**Steps to add:**
1. Copy `assets/seamus-obrien-portrait-hero.jpg` (or your portrait image)
2. Rename it to `seamus-portrait.jpg`
3. Place it in `apps/ai-restaurant-guy/public/seamus-portrait.jpg`

**Note:** The code is already set up correctly - it just needs the image file in place.
